        India, &nbsp; officially the Republic of India,<u>(ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya)</u>[20] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country in the world by area and the most populous country. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and <mark>the Bay of Bengal on the southeast</mark>, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;<sup>[j]</sup> China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and <b>Bangladesh and Myanmar</b> to the east. In the <strong>Indian Ocean</strong>, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its <small>Andaman and Nicobar Islands</small> a maritime border with <i> Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.</i>
<em>Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa</em> no later than 55,000 years ago.[22][23][24] 
<br><br>Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.<sub>[25] </sub>Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[27][28] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[29] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[30] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[31] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[32] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[33] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[34] but also marked by the declining status of women,[35] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][36] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[37]
